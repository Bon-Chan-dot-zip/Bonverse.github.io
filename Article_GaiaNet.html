              <h2>Datamion</h2>
              <p>The datamion is an elementary particle with entirely porgrammable properties. In its normal state it is gaseous, completely transparent, and entirely unreactive to anything, not only that but unlike normal gasses, it does not disperse in air and is in fact heavier than it, and simply remains as a nearly visible blob. When coming into contact with human intent the properties of the substance, called Alkahest, begin to change according to that intent. So for example, if a person sticks their hands into a bucket of Alkahest with the intent to have it become a iron bar, the Datamions will begin to change their properties and react with the surrounding matter to transform into an iron bar. While it sounds similar to alchemy, the fact is that the transformation is not permanent, as without continous feedback, the transformed obejct will begin to deteriorate back into Alkahest. It chaotic nature and impermanence was planned to be of great use, until the mining drill that was found the substance first broke into a chamber full of it. Due to the panic of the crews at the site, they believed that it would spread into the atmosphere, so following their beliefes This event released enough of the Alkahest that it mingled with the air and atmosphere of the planet.  </p>
              <h2>GaiaNet</h2>
              <p>GaianetÂ was a revolutionary technology created by humans in the early 2030s. The catalyst for its creation was the discovery of an entirely new elementary particle, dubbed, the Datamion. GaiaNet is the name for the datamion bubble surrounding the earth</p>
