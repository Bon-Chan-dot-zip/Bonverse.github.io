               <h2>Dollrot</h2>
               <p>A person infected with the disease will slowly turn into a doll-like being. </p>
               <p>&nbsp</p>
               <p>Dollrot is a disease that has been around for all of known history. It appears to be contracted at random, as no environmental conditions or genetic links have been found to indicate any sort of pattern in those affected by it. In the initial stages an infected person may discover that a patch of their skin has turned into porcelain, perfectly melding with the surrounding flesh, during this the porcelain is soft like skin and causes no discomfort. As the disease progresses, this area of porcelain will harden begin to spread to the rest of their body. At around 50% surface area converted, internal organs and flesh will appear to vanish, fading out of reality until nothing but empty space remains. This process finishes at close to 90% conversion. When no biological material remains, the infected is then treated as a part of the Doll race.</p>
               <p>&nbsp</p>
               <p>Conversion is not painful, and rarely feels uncomfortable. Unlike how it may seem, the organs vanishing does not actually kill the person, nor does becoming entirely inorganic. Research has shown that the organs appear to be converted into energy and stored as data within GaiaNet. These organs continue to function in a digital form, and are the reason why Dolls do not die the moment their organs vanish.</p>
               <p>&nbsp</p>
               <p>It is not curable nor reversible. Surgery to remove affected parts is possible but not advised, as probability of contracting it a second time increases by 350%. An alternative come in the form of a device person can wear that halts the progression of the disease.</p>

               <h2>Rustlord's contagion</h2>
               <p>A person infected with this disease will have their bones turn into a metal, which will fuse together and force the person into paralysis</p>
               <p>&nbsp</p>
               <p>This disease is relatively recent, with cases appearing only after the beginning of the Rustlord's conquest. A person may contract this disease after touching an metal object with contaminated with Rusticium. Medical assistance must be provided within 48 hours or it will be too late. The disease is dormant within those 47 hours and quickly begins to take hold in the last hour. Should it be too late it is advised that the person choose wether to be sitting or standing for the rest of their short life.</p>
               <p>&nbsp</p>
               <p>The disease itself does a number of things. First it will quickly convert the bones of the afflicted person into the metal that they had touched and was contaminated with rusticium. While this itself may not seem all too harmful it is worth noting that they will be unable to produce any more bloodcells at all, and the metal itself will seep into the surrounding tissue, causing health complications regarding to that metal's effects on the human body. After that initial stage the surrounding tissue will also start to convert, also meaning that the bones will fuse with each other. Brain death follows, typically within a month, as the metal will have reached the brain and start converting it too.</p>
               <p>&nbsp</p>
               <p>It is not infectious whatsoever and poses no threat to other people apart from the person that is infected.</p>
               <p>&nbsp</p>
               <p>It is worth noting that the metal within the person cannot actually be harvested as it is chemically not the metal itself, but a sort of organic reproduction made to replicate the metal. The bodies of the dead are typically burned, as the metal will dry and crumble into a chalk-like dust, which is occasionally used as fertilizer within small communities.</p>
