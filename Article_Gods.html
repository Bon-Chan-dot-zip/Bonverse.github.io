                <h2>Outer Gods</h2>
                <p> Outer gods are beings of immense power, there is a hierarchy, with some being simply really powerful beings to beyond multiversal concepts. But generally, those that carry this title simply reside in multiple or higher spatial dimensions, or realms, and have some power over reality. Because of their nature, mortals tend to have an <em>extremely</em> hard time when meeting or seeing their true forms, typically resulting in madness or death, simply having knowledge of them can induce a similar effect, thus they go by epithets which provide an anti-cognitohazard effect. To be a follower of an outer god you quite literally need their permission to worship them, if you dont get it, you will be entirely incapable of doing any kind of act of worship, as the will of said god will prevent you from doing so. Most gods also have a domain (Yeah I know like jjk, shut up I got this idea from Fate unlimited bladeworks), basically an extra-dimensional plane of existence solely reserved for that god and permitted people </p>
                <h3>Queen of Bronze</h3>
                <p>The Queen of Bronze is an the outer god who hold domain over machines, brass, and bronze. </p>
                <p><i>The Queen is quite powerful, Ranking somewhere within the upper class out of all the gods, and 2nd in the local group. Generally she tends to avoid the other gods with exception to the Sovereign, who's basically her boss. Mostly spends her time either in her domain or on some world where there are people. Speaking of domain, Ive never actually been to her's, she rarely lets other people in, the only person I know whos been there is Ciril so Im just going to paraphrase what he said when he left. Quote, "Its a vast open field of orange-tinted tall grass, so many machines that I dont recognize just lie half buried in the ground, I couldnt exactly tell what they were supposed to be but I kinda just instinctively knew they were broken, or damaged. There was also a clear blue sky but no sun in sight, yet everything was lit as if there was. In the middle of it all theres a victorian-esque mansion with a massive garden in front. I checked out the garden and found that none of the flowers or plants I saw were organic, all of them were made of metal, there were so many of them good lord you should have seen it. The mansion itself wasnt as interesting, beige bricks and bronze roof tiles. I-I cant quite recall what the interior looked like, but I think there mightve been a workshop in there...". There you have it. The Queen herself is really nice, though she does align more to neutrality she seems to have a soft spot for humans. Unlike other gods, she doesent take a lot of followers, Not like it matters a lot but it is a bit odd, Currently its only me, Ciril and some other guy. As for her backstory... Im not cleared to say it, sorry.</i></p>
