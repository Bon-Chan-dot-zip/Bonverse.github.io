                <h2>Outer Gods</h2>
                <p> Outer gods are beings of immense power, there is a hierarchy, with some being simply really powerful beings to beyond multiversal concepts. But generally, those that carry this title simply reside in multiple or higher spatial dimensions, or realms, and have some power over reality. Because of their nature, mortals tend to have an <em>extremely</em> hard time when meeting or seeing their true forms, typically resulting in madness or death, simply having knowledge of them can induce a similar effect, thus they go by epithets which provide an anti-cognitohazard effect. To be a follower of an outer god you quite literally need their permission to worship them, if you dont get it, you will be entirely incapable of doing any kind of act of worship, as the will of said god will prevent you from doing so. Most gods also have a domain (Yeah I know like jjk, shut up I got this idea from Fate unlimited bladeworks), basically an extra-dimensional plane of existence solely reserved for that god and permitted people </p>
                <p><i>Note: I had to interview people to get this info, for some reason, anytime I found written text it self censors itself, so only transcripts for this entry.   </i></p>

                <h3>Queen of Bronze</h3>
                <p>The Queen of Bronze is an the outer god who hold domain over machines, brass, and bronze. </p>
                <p><i>The Queen is quite powerful, Ranking somewhere within the upper class out of all the gods, and 2nd in the local group. Generally she tends to avoid the other gods with exception to the Sovereign, who's basically her boss. Mostly spends her time either in her domain or on some world where there are people. Speaking of domain, Ive never actually been to her's, she rarely lets other people in, the only person I know whos been there is Ciril so Im just going to paraphrase what he said when he left. Quote, "Its a vast open field of orange-tinted tall grass, so many machines that I dont recognize just lie half buried in the ground, I couldnt exactly tell what they were supposed to be but I kinda just instinctively knew they were broken, or damaged. There was also a clear blue sky but no sun in sight, yet everything was lit as if there was. In the middle of it all theres a victorian-esque mansion with a massive garden in front. I checked out the garden and found that none of the flowers or plants I saw were organic, all of them were made of metal, there were so many of them good lord you should have seen it. The mansion itself wasnt as interesting, beige bricks and bronze roof tiles. I-I cant quite recall what the interior looked like, but I think there mightve been a workshop in there...". There you have it. The Queen herself is really nice, shes optimistic, caring and understanding, though Id say she aligns more to neutrality or free-spiritedness. Unlike other gods, she doesent take a lot of followers, Not like it matters a lot but it is a bit odd, Currently its only me, Ciril and some other guy. As for her past... Im not cleared to say it, sorry.</i></p>

                <h3>Sovereign of Rusted Gold</h3>
                <p>The Sovereign of Rusted Gold is an outer god who hold domain over gold, strength, power.</p>
                <p><i>My liege is incredibly powerful, The strongest of the local group and the elite within the macrocosm. With that power come many responsibilities, which he fulfiills dutifully from within his fortress of gold. Hm? His domain? Its a glorious castle, built from dark stone bricks and accented by tarnished gold. So large and unending that its as if it was made for giants. In the center he sits upon the golden throne in his royal yellow garments. He prides himself in being a balancing force to the universe, squashing all that fly too close to the sun for he has seen what happens when te greed for power is unrestricted. But do not misunderstand, he is not cruel, I would go so far as to say that he is sympathetic in spirit, and is willingly to share his wisdom, for he is humble and does enjoy when one tries their best to achieve something. For this reason he does not turn away anyone who wishes to be his follower, as it is because of our help that he may find a reprieve in his eternity, and find satisfaction in the fact that others share his views. We his loyal knights all follow under his command, He trains us in all the arts possible so that we can do our duties without fail. He rarely speaks of his past, but I have heard rumors that before he became an outer god he was a god of peace. I believe that I have said everything of relevance, I shall take my leave.</i></p>

                <h3>Voice of Agony</h3>
                <p>I could not for the life of me find any information on this guy, I couldnt find any followers and the other three refuse to speak about him. The only information I got was from a nightmare. </p>
                <p>Voice of Agony is a non-physical, conceptual-type outer god, theyre not very powerful, probably the weakest of the local group. They have no domain, no followers, and their mental form is just a silent void. From what I can tell they rule over the domains of pain, curses, and oddly enough, perserverance.</p>
                <p></p>
                <h3>Seraph of the Iron Tempest</h3>
                <p>The Seraph of the Iron Tempest is an outer god who hold domain over war, firearms, iron, and iron derivatives</p>
                <p><i>My lady is quite the powerhouse, but shes nowhere close to the others as shes a new addition to the group, quite young compared to the rest. She tends to not interact other gods as shes too busy stirring up wars and such in other worlds. Shes a feisty one I tell ya, but I guess thats what happens when you're the god of war and all. Shes rash, reckless, and has a weird temperment. You never know when she'll just explode one day, both literally, and metaphorically. She treats us all like her children and soldiers, like one day shes doting on us, yknow mourning the dead after a battle and the next we're singing gospels about the glory of the .45. We dont mind though, we love it there, you have a thing called valhalla in your world? Yeah its like that up there in her domain. We all died in a war and she gave us the choice to follow her. Up there its like a magnificent ancient city in the clouds, ivory arches, golden gates, and cant forget the massive iron statues of different firearms, and the whole military base vibe. Like one place you're chilling in the sunlight and 5 steps forward you're on the range magdumping your gun. Yeah, She Loves her guns, man you should see her when shes on the battlefield, she doesent even reload, she just manifests a new gun and throws the other one away. I really aint got more to say, I got a battle coming up so bye.</i></p>
