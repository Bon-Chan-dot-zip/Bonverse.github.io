                <h2>Sectors</h2>
                <p> After the collapse, GaiaNet was greatly affected. This caused errors and instabilites which results in its "fracturing" into multiple disconnected subnets. Two pre-collapse subnets that were affected were the DimNet and TerraNet. DimNet was a subnet responsible for keeping the rest of the subnets from causing any spatial anomalies and rectifying any if they did occur. TerraNet was a corporate owned subnet used for terraforming. After the collpase these two systems went haywire. Leading to planet-wide catastrophies such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, spatial implosions, dimensional shifts, etc. In the current day these two subnets have been mostly inactive for many centuries, meaning that consistent and reliable exploration of the planet is now feasible. Because of the inconsistency of linear travel, individual landmasses and continents arent used often to denote regions. Instead, regions are placed under the name of Sectors, and are determined by biomes, local geography, ecology, history, etc. A sector with a number in front of its name is a sector that has been explored but then changed in some way, the number in front denotes the amount of times it has changed. The following are <em>known</em> sectors, though not necessarily explored entirely.</p>
                <h3>Hadal-2</h3>
                <p>Hadal-2 is a region denoted by its semi-cold climate and near-eternal twilight. The entire region appears to have a false sky, leading to an erratic night-day cycle. Northern and central regions typically switch between various stages of dusk and dawn, with an average of 50 days where the sun is entirely up in the sky per year, the more south you go the more average full sunlight days, reaching up to an average of 170 full sunlight days per year. Mostly covered in a taiga, changing to temperate decidous forests in the southern regions of the sector. Local ecology has changed to adapt to the day-night cylce, with more luminescent organisms and flora that is much more efficient at doing photosynthesis </p>                  
                
                <p><em>Fun fact! local populations of Eiriksvollians and Izdrazians have increased optical acuity and are less likely to be affected by eye defects and diseases.</em></p>
                <!--<p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Aphelion-18</h3>
                <p> No data </p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Pheta-7</h3>
                <p>The region that encompasses the north pole and arctic circle.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Deltho-3</h3>
                <p>The region That encompasses the south pole and antarctic circle.</p>
                <p><em>Note: Pheta-7's and Deltho-3's environmental conditions are far too extreme to be explored properly, little data has been gathered on them.</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Asphodel-21</h3>
                <p>Asphodel-21 is a region denoted by its temperate climate and vibrant birch forests. While the birch forests are the most well-known part of the region, they only account for 35% of the entire region, with the rest it being mostly tall-grass steppes. </p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Duat-32</h3>
                <p>A region of hot deserts and dunes.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p> -->
                <h3>Aaru-14</h3>
                <p>Aaru-14 is a region denoted by the absurdly expansive steppe biome, temperate climate and semi-aridity. This region undergoes little snowfall and very little precipitation. Biodiverisity is not a particular strong point, common fauna include bison, rodents, and some felids, while fauna is essentially just different species of short grass, with the occasional shrub or flower. This sector also contains some rivers and streams, though they are few and farm between. Satellite imagery cannot be trusted as the area shown appears far less than what it is in reality. To emphasize its extent, Angshire has laid claim on a great deal of territory, roughly the same as the entire Niflheim snowstorm, and yet is still not even more than 25% of the total <em>explored</em> area. </p>

                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Niflheim-7</h3>
                <p>Niflheim-7 is a region denoted by its eternal snowstorm and cold climate. While geographic surveying is possible, it is not particularly useful due to the fact that the snowstorm blocks most of the view of the land. In the middle of the sector is a massive snowstorm that has been raging on since explorers first discovered it. Average temperatures within the storm's radius range from -17C on the fringes and -42C in the central areas. Most of the sector's land is taken up by the storm, everything else is a cold arid tundra with an average temperature of 10C. About the storm's radius, it is estimated to be around 1500km +- 200km due to seasonal variantions. This region is abundant with metallic ore deposits and oil reserves, leading to it becoming a hotspot for economic growth and industry.</p>

                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Hvergel-26</h3>
                <p>Hvergel-26 is a region denoted by its extremely humid climate. Bogs, marshes and swamps dominate the landscape and most of the land is often submerged under water, making it nearly intraversable due to its inherently dangerous and unstable terrain. While fairly expansive this region is sparsely populated by farmers and small communities of the native population. This region supports a vast array of diverse life and is a hotspot for agriicultural and biological studies.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Shambhala-5</h3>
                <p>Shambhala-5 is a region of extreme altitude. An expansive mountain range dominates most of the region. While located around the equator its ecology is more similar to more polar regions, which is attributed to the region’s high average altitude and lower temperatures. It is not only the longest continuous mountain range but also has some of the highest peaks in the entire world.  While the region is low in ressources, its claim to relevancy is held up by its relatively high occurence of netcrystal formations and archeological discoveries.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Agartha-Null</h3>
                <!--<p>This technically isint a region but a set of region where the labyrinth spreads close to the surface</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Nine-C</h3>
                <p>Nine-C</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Judas-15</h3>
                <p>A Mediterranean like region, semi-arid and mostly chapparal.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Annwn-12</h3>
                <p>Annwn-12 </p>
                <p>&nbsp</p> -->
                <h3>Ava-n</h3>
                <p>A region of temperate forests and rainforests, like agartha-null it is more a collection of non-continuous region, classified together only because of extreme similarity. It breaks the typical naming conventions as when speaking about a specific region in ava-n, the “n” in the name is replaced by the corresponding number of that region. Eg: Ava-14.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Labyrinth</h3>
                <p>The labyrinth is a massive complex deep under the earths surface. Almost half alive it is forever expanding and changing. The megastructure is composed of labyrinth steel. It is estimated to spans the entirety of the planet and is vastly unknown as its depths have never been penetrated before. Light is not scarce as it is anomalously present without any visible light source. Very few things grow here naturally and even less are of flesh and blood. The labyrinth is built just above the mantle and below the crust of the earth. It doesnt affect the geological activities and movement of the tectonic plates as it effectively acts as an extension of the mantle, being able to withstand such pressures and temperatures while at the same time maintaining the same properties as the original mantle. The gravity of the planet is not affected, as the megastructure's average density and mass causes surface gravity to remain at the correct intensity</p>
                <p><em>The structure is ancient— Far older than history suggests. On my expedition I found hallways and rooms perfectly designed for humans, objects fit for our hands. Old remnants of images and words on these walls have faded to unrecognizable shapes over eons. No records indicate any sort of human habitation within this area and yet, it was designed, intricately crafted, for us.</em></p>
