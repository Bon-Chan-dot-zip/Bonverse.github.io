                <h2>Sectors</h2>
                <p> After the collapse, GaiaNet was greatly affected. This caused errors and instabilites which results in its "fracturing" into multiple disconnected subnets. Two pre-collapse subnets that were affected were the DimNet and TerraNet. DimNet was a subnet responsible for keeping the rest of the subnets from causing any spatial anomalies and rectifying any if they did occur. TerraNet was a corporate owned subnet used for terraforming. After the collpase these two systems went haywire. Leading to planet-wide catastrophies such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, spatial implosions, dimensional shifts, etc. In the current day these two subnets have been mostly inactive for many centuries, meaning that consistent and reliable exploration of the planet is now feasible. Because of the inconsistency of linear travel, individual landmasses and continents arent used often to denote regions. Instead, regions are placed under the name of Sectors, and are determined by biomes, local geography, ecology, history, etc. A sector with a number in front of its name is a sector that has been explored but then changed in some way, the number in front denotes the amount of times it has changed. The following are <em>known</em> sectors, though not necessarily explored entirely.</p>
                <h3>Hadal-2</h3>
                <p>Hadal-2 is a region denoted by its cold climate and eternal twilight. Mostly covered in forests with sparse patches of grasslands. Satellite images show that it is within the northern hemisphere, </p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Aphelion</h3>

                <h3>Deltho-3</h3>
                <p>The region That encompasses the south pole and antarctic circle.</p>

                <h3>Asphodel-12</h3>
                <p>Asphodel-12 is a region denoted by its temperate climate and vibrant birch forests.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Duat-4</h3>
                <p>A region of hot deserts and dunes.</p>

                <h3>Aaru</h3>
                <p>An expansive grassy plain, really not much to be said apart from its prairie like climate</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Niflheim</h3>
                <p>A region dictated by its eternal snowstorm and cold climate, most of the territory is an icefield but the fringes are either tundras or taigas.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Hvergel-6</h3>
                <p>A region dictated by its extreme wetness, a land of intense humidity, swamps, lakes, and bogs.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Shambhala</h3>
                <p>A region with extreme alpine conditions.</p>

                <h3>Agartha-Null</h3>
                <p>This technically isint a region but a set of region where the labyrinth spreads close to the surface</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Nine-C</h3>
                <p>Region categorized by its odd shape, it is a massive mountain, or quarry-like structure where a a suprisingly large biodiversity flourishes.</p>

                <h3>Judas-5</h3>

                <h3>Annwn-2</h3>
                <p>Annwn-2 is a sector denoted by its highland topography, </p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Ava-n</h3>
                <p>A region of temperate forests and rainforests, like agartha-null it is more like a collection of region, classified together only because of extreme similarity. It breaks the typicall naming convention as when speaking about a specific region in ava-n, the “n” in the name is replaced by the corresponding number. Eg: Ava-14.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
