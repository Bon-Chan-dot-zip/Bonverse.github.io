                <h2>Sectors</h2>
                <p> After the collapse, GaiaNet was greatly affected. This caused errors and instabilites which results in its "fracturing" into multiple disconnected subnets. Two pre-collapse subnets that were affected were the DimNet and TerraNet. DimNet was a subnet responsible for keeping the rest of the subnets from causing any spatial anomalies and rectifying any if they did occur. TerraNet was a corporate owned subnet used for terraforming. After the collpase these two systems went haywire. Leading to planet-wide catastrophies such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, spatial implosions, dimensional shifts, etc. In the current day these two subnets have been mostly inactive for many centuries, meaning that consistent and reliable exploration of the planet is now feasible. Because of the inconsistency of linear travel, individual landmasses and continents arent used often to denote regions. Instead, regions are placed under the name of Sectors, and are determined by biomes, local geography, ecology, history, etc. A sector with a number in front of its name is a sector that has been explored but then changed in some way, the number in front denotes the amount of times it has changed. The following are <em>known</em> sectors, though not necessarily explored entirely.</p>
                <h3>Hadal-2</h3>
                <p>Hadal-2 is a region denoted by its semi-cold climate and near-eternal twilight. The entire region appears to have a false sky, leading to an erratic night-day cycle. Northern and central regions typically switch between various stages of dusk and dawn, with an average of 50 days where the sun is entirely up in the sky per year, the more south you go the more average full sunlight days, reaching up to an average of 170 full sunlight days per year. Mostly covered in a taiga, changing to temperate decidous forests in the southern regions of the sector. Local ecology has changed to adapt to the day-night cylce, with more luminescent organisms and flora that is much more efficient at doing photosynthesis. </p>                  
                <img src="Forest.png" alt="A dark forest">
                <p><em>Fun fact! local populations of Eiriksvollians and Izdrazians have increased optical acuity and are less likely to be affected by eye defects and diseases.</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Aphelion</h3>
                <p> No data </p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Pheta-7</h3>
                <p>The region that encompasses the north pole and arctic circle.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Deltho-3</h3>
                <p>The region That encompasses the south pole and antarctic circle.</p>
                <p><em>Note: Pheta-7's and Deltho-3's environmental conditions are far too extreme to be explored properly, little data has been gathered on them.</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Asphodel-12</h3>
                <p>Asphodel-12 is a region denoted by its temperate climate and vibrant birch forests.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Duat-4</h3>
                <p>A region of hot deserts and dunes.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Aaru</h3>
                <p>Aaru is a region denoted by the absurdly expansive steppe biome, temperate climate and semi-aridity. Angshire has claimed a lot of territory and yet is still not even more than 25% of the total <em>explored</em> area. Satellite imagery cannot be trusted as the area shown appears far less than what it is in reality, though it appears to be within the northern hemisphere. Currently undergoing a bit of scrutiny as a vast majority agriculture is performed here and some worry that it might lead to ecological damage. </p>

                 <p><em>Note: As of writing, Anshire officials have promised to limit the use of the land, despite the negligible ecological damage caused by the agriculture industry</em></p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Niflheim</h3>
                <p>Niflheim is a region denoted by its eternal snowstorm and cold climate. In the middle of the sector is a massive snowstorm that has been raging on since explorers first discovered it. Average temperatures within the storm's radius range from -17C on the fringes and -42C in the central areas. Most of the sector's land is taken up by the storm, everything else is a cold arid tundra with an average temperature of 10C. This region is abundant with metallic ore deposits and oil reserves, leading to it becoming a hotspot for economic growth and industry.</p>

                <h3>Hvergel-6</h3>
                <p>A region dictated by its extreme wetness, a land of intense humidity, swamps, lakes, and bogs.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Shambhala</h3>
                <p>A region with extreme alpine conditions.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Agartha-Null</h3>
                <p>This technically isint a region but a set of region where the labyrinth spreads close to the surface</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Nine-C</h3>
                <p>Region categorized by its odd shape, it is a massive mountain, or quarry-like structure where a a suprisingly large biodiversity flourishes.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Judas-5</h3>
                <p>A Mediterranean like region, semi-arid and mostly chapparal.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Annwn-2</h3>
                <p>Annwn-2 is a sector denoted by its highland topography, </p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Ava-n</h3>
                <p>A region of temperate forests and rainforests, like agartha-null it is more like a collection of region, classified together only because of extreme similarity. It breaks the typicall naming convention as when speaking about a specific region in ava-n, the “n” in the name is replaced by the corresponding number. Eg: Ava-14.</p>
                <p>&nbsp</p>
                <h3>Labyrinth</h3>
